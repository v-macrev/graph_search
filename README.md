# graph_search
 An assigment for the Accelerated Computer Science Fundamentals Specialization from the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign. In this assignment I implemented some helper functions for a graph class, then learned about using BFS to solve problems in general graphs, such as computing shortest paths or solving a puzzle automatically.
